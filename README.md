#Project layout
I've set up a basic project layout with I hope will help us design and test quickly. See the READMEs in each directory.
Let me know if you have any suggestions or concerns.

#Suggested Workflow (Updated)

Everyone create your own branch and do your work within it.
This way, we can work on several modules at the same time without stepping on each others' feet
since each module will be in its own branch.
I'll handle merges it into `master`.
This way, all you have to do to get what everyone else has done so far is merge `master` into your branch.
Also feel free to pull from each others' branches.

#Coding Style

Since we have several files checked in already using this style, can we agree to use tabs for indentation?
That way it's consistent and you can adjust the tab width in your editor to make it look however you want.
