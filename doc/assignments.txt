Overall plan:
Start out with modular testing.
Each function is tested on its own using the scripts in the scripts/ directory.
See below for details.

In the main test bench we will combine everything
and test against all values (see A2D_vals.txt).
Command mode will also be tested.

Main tasks: 
	1) Command mode
	2) Normal mode

Main state machine: Adam
	planned tests:
	- Check outputs for all states and conditions
	- Check proper control flow for both normal and command mode

Synthesis: Adam

CORDIC: Matt
	planned tests:
	- Test CORDIC against all possible values.

Repo management: Matt

Command Module: Ben
	planned tests:
	- Test the functionality of datapath
	- Force the sm into mult state/ cordic state

Datapath: Ben
	planned tests:
	- Math ops (CORDIC, Booth Multiply, etc.) should sufficiently test the datapath

Booth multiply: Lars
	planned tests: 
	- Test every possible value.
